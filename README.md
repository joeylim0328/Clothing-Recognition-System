# Clothing-Recognition-System
This is a simple clothing recognition system that classifies a clothing item into one of 10 classes by applying deep learning models. The 10 classes are belt, covered shoes, dress, high heels, pants, shirt, skirt, slippers, socks and spectacles. Two deep learning models are experimented, multilayer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural network (CNN).
